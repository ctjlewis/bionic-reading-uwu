`Bionic Reading is a new method
facilitating the reading process
by guiding the eyes through
text with artificial fixation points.
As a result, the reader is only
focusing on the highlighted
initial letters and lets the brain
center complete the word.
In a digital world dominated
by shallow forms of reading,
Bionic Reading aims to
encourage a more in-depth
reading and understanding of
written content.`;
